# aws-load-balancer-and-auto-scaling-group
This is an implementation of an AWS architecture using an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to ensure high availability and scalability. The setup automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances and adjusts the number of instances based on demand, optimizing both performance and cost-efficiency.
